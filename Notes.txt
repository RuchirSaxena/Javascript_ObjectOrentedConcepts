===================

Syantax Prarsers , Execution Context and Lexical Scope/Enviorment
=========================================================
Syantax Prarsers => A program that reads your code and determines what it does and if its Grammer is Valid or not

Lexical Enviroment =>Where something(code) sits physically in the code you write.

Execution Context =>A wrraper to help manage the code that is running  , so basically there are lots of Lexical Enviorments but which one is curently running is managed by the execution contexts.It can contain things beyond what you have wrritten in your code.
